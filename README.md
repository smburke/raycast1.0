A simple fake 3D raycasting engine.
Some code has been adapted from Javidx9's command line raycast engine.

This is an updated version which is a textureless fully graphical version using SDL as its API.
This was made solely as an exercise in familiarizing myself with basic computer graphics, certain Windows libraries, and Microsoft Visual Studio as a creation tool.
